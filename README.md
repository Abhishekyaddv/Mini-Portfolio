Pastel Dreams: An Interactive Personal Portfolio
Pastel Dreams is a visually engaging, single-page personal portfolio designed with a soft, anime-inspired aesthetic. It serves as a beautiful and interactive hub for linking to professional profiles, projects, and online shops. The layout is clean, modern, and built to capture attention with subtle animations and a unique, dreamy atmosphere.

This project was created to be a lightweight but feature-rich alternative to traditional portfolio websites. It leverages pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create a responsive and delightful user experience. The design prioritizes aesthetics and user interaction, featuring a dynamic background, a custom cursor, and an integrated background music player to create an immersive environment for visitors.
